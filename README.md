Understand that Simple Linear Regression is a method used to predict a dependent variable (Y) based on an independent variable (X).

The first step usually involves importing the necessary libraries. Typically, you'd use libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn.

You need to load the dataset, which is often provided as a CSV file. The lab instructions should provide a URL or path to the dataset.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data. This includes checking for null values, data types, and basic statistics.

Prepare your data for modeling. This might involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into features (X) and target (Y)

Split your data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

Use the training data to train your Simple Linear Regression model.

Use the trained model to make predictions on the test data.

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared.

Plot the regression line along with the data points to visualize the fit.
